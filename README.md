## Features

### Consistency

This is the core feature of CandyBox Cheater, and that's why I created it in the first place.

CandyBox Cheater doesn't let you mess up your save by setting dependent variables to an inconsistent state. The full dependency graph of the game is integrated in the cheater so that every change triggers all the necessary changes to keep everything consistent.

### Simplicity

With this simple UI using checkboxes, no more digging into that big bunch of text representing the save, and no more typo crashing the load of the save.
